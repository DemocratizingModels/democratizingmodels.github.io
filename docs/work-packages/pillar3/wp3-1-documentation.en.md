# WP 3.1: Documentation and Outreach

## Overview

The first task of Pillar 3 focuses on creating accessible and comprehensive documentation and educational resources to lower the entry barriers for diverse user groups, for both developers and non-developers. This work package is essential for ensuring widespread adoption and understanding of the DEMOS standard across the ErUM community.

## Objectives

- Create comprehensive, accessible documentation for all user levels
- Develop engaging educational resources and multimedia content
- Organize regular workshops, hackathons, and training sessions
- Integrate DEMOS standard into educational curricula and outreach programs
- Ensure the standard is featured in authoritative physics publications
- Build a diverse and inclusive community through targeted outreach

## Documentation Resources

### User Manuals and Guides

Comprehensive user manuals, FAQs, and best-practice guidelines will be developed and made available through the portal. These materials will:

- Serve both new and experienced users
- Cover all aspects of model creation, serialization, and sharing
- Provide troubleshooting guides and common pitfalls

### Particle Data Group (PDG) Articles

**RUB-H**, as an active PDG member, will ensure DEMOS standard visibility:

- **PDG Review Articles (2028.Q1):** Feature DEMOS standard in existing reviews
- **New PDG Review Article:** Advocate for a dedicated article on modeling practices and model sharing, addressing emerging needs for standardized computational research approaches

These PDG publications will provide authoritative documentation and establish DEMOS as a recognized standard in the physics community.

### Domain-Specific Publications

Model standardization (WP 1.1) will culminate in field-specific publications detailing:

- Standardization of terminology, conventions, and notation
- Best practices for each domain
- Common primitives and building blocks
- Integration examples with domain-specific tools

## Educational Outreach

### Masterclass for Pupils

**Led by:** JGU and RUB-H
**Target Audience:** High school students
**Timeline:** 2028.Q1

The masterclass on hadron physics will:

- Highlight potential applications of the DEMOS project
- Use models from the DEMOS registry to interpret experimental data
- Provide interactive exploration of physics phenomena
- Demonstrate how students can engage with cutting-edge research

**Integration:** Collaboration with Netzwerk Teilchenwelt, featuring a new BES III Masterclass currently under development at JGU

### Research School

**Led by:** RUB-H team
**Duration:** One week
**Target Audience:** Undergraduate students across Germany
**Timeline:** 2028.Q2
**Participants:** 40 students
**Budget:** 25k€ for accommodation, lunches, and coffee breaks

This unique research school will focus on research models in ErUM, taking advantage of:

- Wide range of research topics across consortium
- Diverse expertise of consortium members
- Vibrant and engaging visualizations from the portal
- Hands-on experience with real scientific models

**Inspiration:** Similar event successfully hosted by RUB-H team at Bochum campus in 2024 ([MTHS2024](https://indico.him.uni-bonn.de/event/213/))

**Interactive Exploration:** Students will explore questions such as:
- How does the length-scale of neutrino oscillation change with different mixing angles?
- To what sheet does a pole in an amplitude move if interaction strength is varied?
- How do model parameters affect observable predictions?

## Accessibility and Inclusivity

All documentation and outreach materials will:

- Be available in multiple formats (text, video, audio)
- Include captions and transcripts for accessibility
- Use clear, jargon-free language where possible
- Provide glossaries for technical terms
- Be available through the open portal

Workshops and events will:

- Actively recruit diverse participants
- Provide financial support where needed
- Offer virtual participation options
- Create inclusive, welcoming environments

## Continuous Feedback and Improvement

The documentation and outreach strategy will evolve based on:

- **User feedback surveys** (2027.Q3 onwards): Regular surveys distributed via mailing lists to gauge user satisfaction and identify areas for improvement
- **Community interaction metrics:** Track engagement with materials and events
- **Adoption indicators:** Monitor usage of standard across collaborations
- **Educational impact assessment:** Evaluate effectiveness of outreach programs

## Success Indicators

By the end of the project (2028.Q3), we expect:

1. **Documentation Coverage:** Complete documentation for all standard features and engines
2. **Event Participation:** 150+ researchers engaged through workshops and training
3. **Educational Resources:** 10 high-quality multimedia resources accessible to diverse audiences

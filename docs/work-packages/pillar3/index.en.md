# Pillar 3: Community Engagement

A broad community engagement is the third pillar of this project, playing a critical role in its overall success. Without an active, supportive, and engaged community, the project risks failing to achieve its ultimate purpose: to facilitate interdisciplinary communication and collaboration through widespread adoption and integration of the DEMOS standard.

## Overview

Community participation is vital not only for using the tools and standards developed, but also for maintaining and evolving them over time. This is why significant resources are dedicated to fostering community involvement, showcasing the potential of the cross-discipline model exchange platform, and integrating model-publication practices into collaboration workflows.

## Work Packages

Pillar 3 consists of three interconnected work packages:

### WP 3.1: Documentation and Outreach
Creating accessible documentation, educational resources, workshops, hackathons, and training sessions to lower entry barriers and promote adoption across the ErUM community.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive user manuals, FAQs, and best-practice guidelines
- Multimedia resources (video tutorials, webinars, interactive examples)
- White paper with detailed DEMOS standard explanations
- PDG review articles featuring the DEMOS standard
- Masterclass for pupils on hadron physics
- One-week research school for undergraduate students

### WP 3.2: Showcasing
Demonstrating the versatility and usability of the DEMOS standard through representative models from diverse fields, experiments, and theoretical frameworks. These examples serve multiple purposes: identifying needed features, highlighting scientific capabilities, providing serialization templates, and establishing standards for interdisciplinary collaboration.

**Key Contributions:**
- Hadron physics models from LHCb, COMPASS, Belle II, BES III
- Particle physics models including Higgs discovery
- Nuclear physics NN interaction models
- Neutrino physics oscillation models
- Astroparticle propagation models
- Laser-matter interaction and warm-dense-matter models

### WP 3.3: Organization and Sustainability
Establishing long-term governance structures to ensure the DEMOS standard and community remain viable beyond the funding period.

**Key Components:**
- Steering committee formation and election process
- Stakeholder representative nomination
- Standardized review process for changes
- Release schedule definition
- Asynchronous communication platforms
- CI-based maintenance pipelines

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **1 community workshop** annually (2 days, ~50 participants)
- **3+ domain-specific mini-workshops** annually (1 day, ~20 participants)
- **2 hackathons** (2025-2026)
- **10 educational resources** (4 videos, 4 blog posts, 2 podcasts)
- **4 learning sessions** at large-scale collaboration meetings
- **3+ models per domain** in registry by 2028
- **1 white paper** submission by 2028.Q3

### Qualitative Metrics
- Adoption of DEMOS standard in collaboration workflows
- Community feedback through surveys
- Stakeholder engagement and representation
- Cross-disciplinary model sharing and reuse
- Educational impact through masterclasses and research school

## Community Interaction Strategy

The project employs multiple channels for community engagement:

1. **Direct Communication:** Asynchronous platforms (Mattermost), mailing lists
2. **Events:** Workshops, hackathons, training sessions, research schools
3. **Publications:** White papers, PDG articles, domain-specific publications
4. **Educational Outreach:** Masterclasses, research schools, multimedia resources
5. **Collaboration Integration:** Learning sessions within existing experiment workflows

## Long-Term Vision

By fostering a vibrant, engaged community around the DEMOS standard, the project aims to create a sustainable ecosystem where:

- Models are routinely published and shared in standardized formats
- Cross-disciplinary collaboration becomes seamless
- New researchers can easily access and build upon existing work
- The standard evolves with community needs through transparent governance
- Educational resources democratize access to complex scientific models

The success of Pillar 3 ultimately determines whether DEMOS becomes a transformative standard for the ErUM community or remains a niche tool. Through comprehensive engagement, showcasing, and sustainability planning, we aim to ensure long-term adoption and impact.

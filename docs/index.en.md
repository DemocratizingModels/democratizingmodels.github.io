## Cross-discipline platform on exchange of research models

**Funding Period:** October 1, 2025 - September 30, 2028
**Funding Agency:** Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)
**Program:** ErUM-Data

## Overview

The national research consortium "Democratizing Models: cross-discipline platform for exchange of research models" focuses on creating a **federated and interoperable platform** for sharing, standardizing, and using probabilistic models across different fields within ErUM (Exploration of the Universe and Matter).

The project addresses key challenges in research data management, ensuring that models are **findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR)**. It aims to support collaboration across disciplines, including:

- **Astrophysics (AP)**
- **Laser Physics (LP)**
- **Particle Physics (PP)**
- **Hadron Physics (HP)**
- **Neutrino Physics (NuP)**
- **Nuclear Physics (NP)**

and promote the effective use of research models in line with the goals of the funding call.

## The Challenge

In the ErUM research fields, a **model** is a mathematical or computational object used to describe a physical process. Models are used to make predictions or to interpret experimental data. They vary greatly in complexity and structure across different applications but often share common elements or features.

Despite their importance, the sharing and dissemination of these models present significant challenges:

- Current practices vary widely across the ErUM community and often lack standardization
- Some domains use sophisticated framework-specific formats or binary files
- Others rely on informal methods, such as sharing code snippets via email
- Models often need to be manually reproduced from mathematical equations in publications—a process that is error-prone and sometimes impossible

These inconsistent and fragmented practices create barriers to collaboration, reproducibility, and knowledge transfer both within and across fields.

## The DEMOS Solution

Our "Democratizing Models" initiative addresses these challenges by proposing the development of a **federated and interoperable DEMOS standard** for sharing, standardizing, and utilizing probabilistic models across the diverse fields of the ErUM community.

The proposal focuses on:

1. Identifying common model structures
2. Creating an extensible mechanism for serializing complex models
3. Enabling seamless interfacing between disciplines

By pioneering this interoperable standard, the DEMOS project aims to transcend existing disciplinary boundaries and establish a shared foundation for model communication.

## Three Foundational Pillars

The proposed project is built on three foundational pillars that collectively drive its vision and implementation:

### Pillar 1: Model Format Standardization

Development of a common standard, including a flexible block-assembling mechanism, ensuring that models of varying complexity can be serialized, shared, and adapted across diverse domains. Computational engines will ensure consistency and enable interactive exploration of the models.

### Pillar 2: Portal & Infrastructure

A platform will be created to facilitate model sharing using the newly developed DEMOS standard. A comprehensive and representative collection of models spanning the key research areas will be compiled to demonstrate the platform's features.

### Pillar 3: Community Engagement

Extensive effort will be dedicated to engaging the ErUM research community to establish the new common DEMOS standard and a user-friendly model registry. Members of our consortium hold leadership positions in several large experimental collaborations and are pioneers of domain-specific standardization initiatives.

## Consortium

The consortium is led by **Prof. Dr. M. Mikhasenko** from Ruhr University Bochum. This proposal is initiated and driven primarily by early-career principal investigators, with senior researchers involved to support the initiative and help promote the adoption of its ideas within the broader community.

The foundation of the project was laid out at the "[Democratizing Models](https://indico.him.uni-bonn.de/event/227/)" workshop.

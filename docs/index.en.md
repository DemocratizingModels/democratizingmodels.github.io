# DEMOS: DEMocratizing MOdelS

**A cross-discipline platform for sharing research models**

DEMOS is a BMBF-funded research consortium (2025-2028) developing a federated and interoperable standard for sharing probabilistic models across ErUM (Exploration of the Universe and Matter) research fields.

---

## What is DEMOS?

DEMOS creates a **common standard and infrastructure** for serializing, sharing, and using research models across multiple physics domains. Our goal is to make models **FAIR**: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

### Research Domains

DEMOS serves researchers across six ErUM fields:

- Particle Physics (PP)
- Hadron Physics (HP)
- Nuclear Physics (NP)
- Neutrino Physics (NuP)
- Astroparticle Physics (AP)
- Laser Physics (LP)

## Our Approach

DEMOS is built on three foundational pillars:

### 1. Model Format Standardization

Developing a common standard with flexible building blocks that enable models of varying complexity to be serialized, shared, and adapted across domains.

### 2. Portal & Infrastructure

Creating a platform to facilitate model discovery and sharing, with computational engines in C++, Python, and Julia.

### 3. Community Engagement

Working with the ErUM research community to establish and promote the DEMOS standard through documentation, showcases, and collaboration.

## Consortium

The consortium is led by **Prof. Dr. Mikhail Mikhasenko** (Ruhr University Bochum) and includes 9 research institutions across Germany and the US.

# The DEMOS Consortium

The DEMOS consortium brings together researchers from 9 institutions across Germany and the United States, representing expertise in all major ErUM (Exploration of the Universe and Matter) physics domains.

## Leadership

**Consortium Speaker: Prof. Dr. Mikhail Mikhasenko**
Experimental Particle Physics (EP1)
Ruhr University Bochum

The initiative is driven primarily by early-career principal investigators, with support from senior researchers.

## Participating Institutions

- **Ruhr University Bochum (RUB)** - three groups covering Hadron Physics, Nuclear Physics, and Astroparticle Physics
- **Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf/CASUS (HZDR)** - Laser Physics
- **TU Dortmund University (TUDO)** - Particle Physics
- **Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz (JGU)** - Hadron Physics
- **Technical University of Munich (TUM)** - Neutrino and Particle Physics
- **Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)** - Particle Physics
- **Max Planck Institute for Physics, Munich (MPP)** - Neutrino and Hadron Physics
- **University of California, Santa Cruz (SC)** - Particle Physics (associated partner)

## Research Domains

The consortium covers all six ErUM domains:

| Domain | Groups |
|--------|--------|
| **Hadron Physics (HP)** | RUB-H, JGU, MPP |
| **Particle Physics (PP)** | TUDO, LMU, TUM, SC |
| **Nuclear Physics (NP)** | RUB-N |
| **Neutrino Physics (NuP)** | TUM, MPP |
| **Astroparticle Physics (AP)** | RUB-A |
| **Laser Physics (LP)** | HZDR |

## Expertise

Consortium members bring key strengths to the project:

- Leadership positions in major experimental collaborations (ATLAS, LHCb, Belle II, IceCube, etc.)
- Lead developers of widely-used tools (PyHF, BAT.jl, ROOT/RooFit)
- Pioneers of standardization initiatives (HS3, amplitude serialization)

This diverse expertise ensures the DEMOS standard will meet the needs of the entire ErUM community.

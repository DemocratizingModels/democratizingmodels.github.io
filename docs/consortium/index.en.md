# The DEMOS Consortium

The DEMOS research consortium brings together expertise from multiple institutions across Germany, representing diverse physics domains within the ErUM (Exploration of the Universe and Matter) fields.

## Consortium Speaker

**Prof. Dr. M. Mikhasenko**
Experimental Particle Physics (EP1)
Ruhr University Bochum

The consortium speaker leads the coordination of this cross-disciplinary initiative.

## Initiative Leadership

This proposal is initiated and driven primarily by **early-career principal investigators**. Senior researchers are involved to support the initiative and help promote the adoption of its ideas within the broader community.

## Foundation

The foundation of the project was laid out at the **"Democratizing Models" workshop** held in 2024.

## Key Contributors

Significant contributions to the proposal have been made by members of the working groups, particularly by PhD students:

- **Lorentz Gartner** (LMU Munich)
- **Remco de Boer** (RUB-H, Ruhr University Bochum)

## Consortium Strengths

Members of our consortium bring unique advantages to the initiative:

- **Leadership positions** in several large experimental collaborations within ErUM fields
- **Lead developers** of widely-used computational tools such as PyHF and BAT.jl
- **Contributors** to the ROOT ecosystem
- **Pioneers** of domain-specific standardization initiatives including:
  - HEP Statistics Serialization Standard (HS3)
  - Amplitude serialization frameworks

These factors will expedite the engagement process and support our goal of achieving widespread acceptance of the DEMOS standard.

## Participating Institutions

The consortium includes eight German institutions and one international associated partner:

- Ruhr University Bochum (RUB) - *three groups*
- Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf/CASUS (HZDR)
- TU Dortmund University (TUDO)
- Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz (JGU)
- Technical University of Munich (TUM)
- Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)
- Max Planck Institute for Physics, Munich (MPP)
- University of California, Santa Cruz (SC) - *associated partner*

## Research Domains Covered

The consortium represents expertise across all major ErUM physics domains:

| Domain | Abbreviation | Consortium Groups |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Hadron Physics | HP | RUB-H, JGU, MPP |
| Particle Physics | PP | TUDO, LMU, TUM, SC |
| Nuclear Physics | NP | RUB-N |
| Neutrino Physics | NuP | TUM, MPP |
| Astroparticle Physics | AP | RUB-A |
| Laser Physics | LP | HZDR |

This diversity ensures that the DEMOS standard will address the needs of the entire ErUM community and enable true cross-disciplinary model sharing.

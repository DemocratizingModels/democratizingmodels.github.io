# Exploitation and Impact

## Democratizing Access to Scientific Models

The DEMOS project establishes a new standard to store and exchange scientific models, ensuring their long-term accessibility, reproducibility, and adaptability. By harmonizing model standards and fostering community engagement, this initiative creates a sustainable ecosystem for sharing and interpreting complex scientific results. Through the platform developed in this project, advanced scientific models—such as those exploring Higgs discovery processes, b-baryon decays, exotic pentaquark and tetraquark states, neutrino oscillations, and particle propagation through the universe—will be accessible to everyone with a single click.

The key strength of this initiative lies in its ability to democratize access to scientific research, aiming to significantly extend established open-science practices. Models that are stored and shared through the DEMOS platform will not only be reusable by researchers within their respective fields but also readily available to individuals across domains.

## Educational Applications

Students, educators, and even younger learners will be able to engage with cutting-edge scientific tools, enhancing their understanding of complex phenomena. This capability transforms these models into powerful educational and exploratory tools, offering answers to questions such as:

- How does the length-scale of neutrino oscillation change with a different mixing angle?
- To what sheet does the pole in an amplitude move if the interaction strength is varied?
- How do parameter variations affect model predictions across different physics domains?

Such questions and many more can easily be explored with DEMOS, offering a powerful tool for the education of the next generation of scientists.

### Netzwerk Teilchenwelt Collaboration

As a first step in educational outreach, we will work closely with the **Netzwerk Teilchenwelt**: a new BESIII Masterclass currently developed at the JGU will use a model stored within the DEMOS project to interpret experimental data. This collaboration demonstrates the immediate educational value of making research models accessible in standardized formats.

The masterclass for pupils on hadron physics, conducted by JGU and RUB-H, will highlight the potential applications of the DEMOS project in scientific outreach activities. Taking advantage of the wide range of research topics and diverse expertise of the consortium members, combined with vibrant and engaging visualizations, we propose organizing a unique one-week research school focused on research models in ErUM, specifically targeting undergraduate students across Germany.

## Long-term Impact and Sustainability

The project is designed to ensure that these models remain accessible and impactful long after its conclusion. A focus on interoperability and community-driven practices will embed the model standard and methodologies into standard workflows across scientific collaborations. These practices will guarantee that the models are preserved, adapted, and expanded as the field evolves.

The infrastructure developed serves as a facilitator, enabling the seamless exchange and validation of models without overshadowing the central goal of advancing model accessibility and utility. By leveraging the consortium's strong ties to a broad field of established collaborations and its commitment to outreach, the project will maximize its impact.

### Community-Driven Contributions

Community-driven contributions will not only populate the system with cutting-edge research models but also expand its reach to new users and disciplines. Tutorials, workshops, and demonstrators will play a critical role in adoption, showcasing the usability and relevance of the standard and tools to a broad audience.

## Success Metrics

Success will be quantified by:

- **Number and diversity of validated models shared** across different physics domains
- **Adoption of the standard across domains** and experimental collaborations
- **Educational resource creation** including tutorials, videos, blog posts, and podcasts
- **Community engagement** measured through workshops, hackathons, and training sessions
- **Integration with major experiments** such as ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, BESIII, Belle II, and others
- **Publications and recognition** in major physics reviews, including Particle Data Group (PDG) articles

The DEMOS standard will be prominently featured in PDG review articles, highlighting its relevance to modern research workflows. Furthermore, RUB-H will advocate for a new PDG review article dedicated to modeling practices and model sharing, addressing the emerging needs of the community for standardized and sustainable approaches to computational research.

## Transformative Vision

This initiative represents a transformative step in the way research models are shared and utilized. By ensuring accessibility and adaptability, it will enable researchers, educators, and learners to explore, reinterpret, and build upon complex scientific insights, advancing the frontiers of science and education alike.

The DEMOS project directly addresses the needs of individual domains while simultaneously benefiting the broader ErUM community. Improving workflows, sharing methodologies, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration will lay the foundation for transparent, open, and repeatable research. Furthermore, DEMOS introduces practices such as unit testing and democratizes access to complex calculations.

By pioneering this interoperable standard, the DEMOS project aims to transcend existing disciplinary boundaries and establish a shared foundation for model communication across astrophysics, laser physics, particle physics, hadron physics, neutrino physics, nuclear physics, and beyond—ensuring that the next generation of scientists has the tools they need to push the boundaries of our understanding of the universe.

# Objectives

## What is a Model in ErUM Research?

In the ErUM (Exploration of the Universe and Matter) research fields, a **model** is a mathematical or computational object used to describe a physical process. Models are used to make predictions or to interpret experimental data. They vary greatly in complexity and structure across different applications but often share common elements or features.

In many cases, the models employed in ErUM research are **non-trivial**, incorporating intricate theoretical frameworks and numerical approximations to describe complex phenomena.

### Model Definition

For the purposes of this project, a model is defined as a **component of the statistical modeling process**. Examples include:

- **Spatial distributions** of dark matter density in the universe
- **Probability distributions** governing particle flows in cosmic ray showers
- **Matrix elements** yielding differential cross-sections in scattering processes

These examples highlight the diversity of applications for models across the ErUM domains and underscore the central role models play in advancing our understanding of fundamental physics.

## The Challenge: Current Model Sharing Practices

Despite their importance, the sharing and dissemination of these models present significant challenges.

### Fragmented Practices

Current practices for sharing models vary widely across the ErUM community and often lack standardization:

- **Sophisticated formats**: Some domains use framework-specific formats or binary files to encode model information
- **Informal methods**: Others rely on sharing code snippets via email to communicate findings
- **Manual reproduction**: Models often need to be manually reproduced from mathematical equations in scientific publications—a process that is **error-prone** and sometimes **impossible** due to insufficient detail

### Barriers to Progress

These inconsistent and fragmented practices create significant barriers:

- **Limited collaboration** both within and across fields
- **Reduced reproducibility** of research results
- **Hindered knowledge transfer** between research groups
- **Limited impact** of research results due to lack of broader adoption

The absence of a standardized, interoperable framework for sharing and utilizing models hinders the broader adoption of research results and limits their impact.

## The DEMOS Solution

Our **"Democratizing Models"** initiative addresses these challenges by proposing the development of a federated and interoperable **DEMOS standard** for sharing, standardizing, and utilizing probabilistic models across the diverse fields of the ErUM community.

### Core Focus

The proposal focuses on:

1. **Identifying common model structures** across different physics domains
2. **Creating an extensible mechanism** for serializing complex models (i.e., exporting models in a standardized format)
3. **Enabling seamless interfacing** between disciplines

### Cross-Disciplinary Scope

This unified standard will enable seamless interfacing between the disciplines of:

- Particle physics
- Hadron physics
- Lattice QCD
- Nuclear physics
- Neutrino physics
- Astroparticle physics
- Laser physics

All of these disciplines are represented in this proposal.

By pioneering this interoperable standard, the DEMOS project aims to **transcend existing disciplinary boundaries** and establish a shared foundation for model communication.

## Primary Objective

The primary objective of DEMOS is to **facilitate knowledge transfer** both within specific research domains and across the broader spectrum of ErUM fields.

This will be achieved through:

1. **Creation of a standardized "language"** for model description
2. **Establishment of a model-sharing platform**
3. **Development of a model registry**
4. **Active engagement** of the ErUM community in adopting and sharing this standard

### Expected Outcomes

A unified model-sharing approach will:

- Significantly improve the **communication of results**
- Ensure that research outcomes can be **stored, reproduced, and verified** by independent teams
- Foster **collaboration and reproducibility** across disciplines
- Enable researchers to **combine and extend models** from different domains

## Three Foundational Pillars

The proposed project is built on three foundational pillars that collectively drive its vision and implementation.

### Pillar 1: Common Standard Development

Development of a **common standard**, including a flexible block-assembling mechanism, will ensure that models of varying complexity can be serialized, shared, and adapted across diverse domains.

**Key Features:**

- Flexible block-assembling mechanism
- Support for models of varying complexity
- Computational engines for consistency
- Interactive model exploration capabilities

### Pillar 2: Platform and Infrastructure

A **platform** will be created to facilitate model sharing using the newly developed DEMOS standard.

**Key Components:**

- Model-sharing platform with user-friendly interface
- Comprehensive model collection spanning key research areas
- Model registry with search and discovery features
- Integration with existing repositories (HEPData, Zenodo)

To demonstrate the platform's features and the use of the DEMOS standard, a comprehensive and representative collection of models spanning the key research areas represented within this consortium will be compiled.

### Pillar 3: Community Engagement

Extensive effort will be dedicated to **engaging the research community** to establish the new common DEMOS standard and a user-friendly model registry within the ErUM community.

**Advantages:**

- Consortium members hold **leadership positions** in several large experimental collaborations
- Team includes **leading developers** of widely-used computational tools (PyHF, BAT.jl)
- Contributors to the **ROOT ecosystem**
- **Pioneers** of domain-specific standardization initiatives (HS3, amplitude serialization)

These factors will expedite the engagement process and support our goal of achieving widespread acceptance of the DEMOS standard.

## FAIR Principles

The DEMOS project ensures that models adhere to the FAIR principles:

- **F**indable: Models can be easily discovered through the registry
- **A**ccessible: Open access to models via the platform
- **I**nteroperable: Common standard enables cross-domain usage
- **R**eusable: Clear documentation and standardized format enable reuse

---

## Success Criteria

The success of DEMOS will be measured by:

1. **Adoption rate** of the DEMOS standard across ErUM domains
2. **Number of models** published using the standard
3. **Cross-disciplinary collaborations** enabled by model sharing
4. **Community engagement** in workshops, training, and contributions
5. **Long-term sustainability** of the standard and infrastructure
6. **Integration** with major experiments and collaborations

By achieving these objectives, DEMOS will transform how research models are shared and utilized in the ErUM community, enabling new scientific discoveries through enhanced collaboration and reproducibility.

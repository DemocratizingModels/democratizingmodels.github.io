# About DEMOS

## The Challenge

In modern physics research, **models** are mathematical or computational objects used to describe physical processes and interpret experimental data. Despite their importance, sharing these models presents significant challenges:

- Practices vary widely across research communities
- Some use framework-specific formats, others share informal code snippets
- Models often need to be manually reproduced from publications—an error-prone process
- No standardized way to share models across disciplines

These barriers limit collaboration, reproducibility, and the broader impact of research.

## Our Solution

**DEMOS (DEMocratizing MOdelS)** creates a unified standard and infrastructure for sharing probabilistic models across all ErUM (Exploration of the Universe and Matter) research fields.

### What We're Building

1. **A Common Standard** - A flexible, extensible format for serializing models
2. **Computational Engines** - Implementation in C++, Python, and Julia
3. **A Sharing Platform** - Web-based registry for discovering and accessing models
4. **Community Adoption** - Documentation, training, and engagement with researchers

## FAIR Principles

DEMOS ensures models are:

- **F**indable - Discoverable through a searchable registry
- **A**ccessible - Open access via web platform and APIs
- **I**nteroperable - Common standard enables cross-domain use
- **R**eusable - Clear documentation and standardized formats

## Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: Model Format Standardization

Developing the DEMOS standard with flexible building blocks that allow models of any complexity to be serialized, shared, and used across domains.

**Key components:**
- JSON-based serialization format
- Standard library of building blocks (distributions, operations)
- Computational engines ensuring consistency
- Support for "Models as a Service" (MaaS) via containers

### Pillar 2: Portal & Infrastructure

Creating a platform for model discovery and sharing.

**Key features:**
- Web front-end with model gallery and search
- Back-end registry with CI/CD pipelines
- Interoperability with HEPData, Zenodo, and other repositories
- Model validation and testing infrastructure

### Pillar 3: Community Engagement

Working with the ErUM community to establish and promote the standard.

**Activities:**
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- Showcase models from all domains
- Workshops and training sessions
- Long-term sustainability planning

## Impact

By establishing a common language for models, DEMOS will:

- Enable cross-disciplinary collaboration
- Improve reproducibility of research results
- Accelerate knowledge transfer across fields
- Make cutting-edge models accessible to educators and students
- Amplify the impact of research investments
